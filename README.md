# libcafe
this is libcafe, a library for us.

i'm trying to make a library in the sense that there will be links collected on pages.
currently planning for a WII theme, this is a personal project so i think i won't get sued?
it's also gonna be integrated with google calendar, probably gonna make it VU specific though.
